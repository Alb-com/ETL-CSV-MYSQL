# ETL-CSV-MYSQL📊​
This project demonstrates a data integration pipeline for an e-commerce business. It was developed as an exercise in data extraction from CSV files, data transformation and loading into MySQL, and query execution to generate insights. Additionally, the project includes exporting query results back into CSV files to showcase data manipulation and reporting skills.

## 📃​ Datasets
E-Commerce Sales Analysis Data:

## 🧪 Tools used
- Python (Pandas,Numpy)
- MySQL
- Excel

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Extraction of multiple CSV datasets from a fictional e-commerce platform.
- Data cleaning, integration, and transformation.
- Creation of MySQL database.
- Loading the processed data into a MySQL database.
- Execution of SQL queries for insights and reporting.
- Export of query results back into CSV files for further analysis.
